## Some database link
```
- MongoDB: mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.sd4be.mongodb.net/test
- Database JSON will be included
```

## Problem Solve
```
- Create single page website with Vuejs
- Create data table
- Push data from JSON File to webpage using Golang
```

## My Confession
```
- To be honest, it is my first time to take
a whole role from frontend to backend with
a website app, which I never try before.
However, thank to this opportunity, I have
more chance to work with it. And it also
improves my documentation reading skills.
- In this project, I am also using MongoDB
to push data, however, I find it easier to
convert them to JSON to work with.
- I am sorry if the page does not work well
and I 2 weeks and 2 days to complete it.
Moreover, I am looking forward to working
with you. Please give me a chance.
- I will include a video to show my work.
- Thank you, Nghia

## Project File
```
- All the website is built in one file:
index.html using Vuejs and Golang
- All database will be contained in file
"db.json" with specific name
```
